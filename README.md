MINI FOOD DELIVERY APP : FOODIFY
# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies 


```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```


```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```



## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run this React Native App. :partying_face:
